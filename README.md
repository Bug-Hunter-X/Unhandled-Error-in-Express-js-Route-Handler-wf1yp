# Express.js Route Handler Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid or missing data.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Problem

The original code attempts to fetch a user from an array based on a user ID passed as a route parameter.  It lacks error handling for:

* **Invalid User IDs:**  The code assumes the `userId` can always be parsed as an integer and that a user with that ID will always exist.  If the ID is not a number or no user matches the ID, the application may crash or return a 500 Internal Server Error.
* **Missing User Data:** If the `users` array is empty, or no matching user is found, no appropriate error response is given to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses these issues by:

1. **Validating the User ID:**  It checks if `userId` can be successfully parsed as an integer.
2. **Handling Missing Users:**  It returns a 404 Not Found response if no user with the given ID is found.
3. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  General error handling mechanisms are in place to prevent application crashes.
